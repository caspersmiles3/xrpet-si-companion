# XRPet SI Companion™ — v1.0

**Don't watch the Ledger. Live with it.**

XRPet is a lightweight, installable companion built around Ripple, XRP and the XRP Ledger. It combines live XRPL WebSocket signals, XRP market data, official Ripple/XRPL updates, grounded Truth Mode, a customizable companion, local memory, evolution, daily missions, rooms, notifications and public-address wallet watching.

## Architecture

- `public/app.js`: companion state, XRPL WebSocket client, UI, local memory/evolution/notifications
- `server.js`: XRP market feed, official-source aggregation, briefings, grounded companion response logic
- `public/sw.js`: offline PWA shell
- `wss://xrplcluster.com/`: live public XRPL WebSocket endpoint

## Privacy and wallet safety

v1.0 stores companion profile, XP, rooms, notification history, preferences, memories, and the watched public XRPL address in the user's browser local storage. The server does not need those values persisted.

**Never enter a seed phrase or private key into XRPet.** Wallet Watch accepts a public XRPL classic address only. Future transaction signing should use an external wallet handoff such as Xaman or another reputable XRPL wallet.

## SI design

The v1.0 SI layer is grounded and provider-neutral. It prioritizes:
1. live XRPL data,
2. public XRP market data,
3. official Ripple/XRPL sources,
4. explicit uncertainty labels.

A model provider can later be plugged into the same server endpoint for broader natural-language reasoning without changing the front end.

## Evolution

Drop → Ripple → Wave → Surge → Nexus → Titan → Legend

Evolution is driven by participation and learning, not investment size.

## Low-maintenance design

The app automatically reads public feeds and live XRPL events. It does not require the creator to manually post content each day.

## Not financial advice

XRPet reports market data and ecosystem information. It does not promise returns or price outcomes.
